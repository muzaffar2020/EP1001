                    <h3>Printed Circuit Boards (PCB)</h3>
                <p>What is a PCB?</br>    
                A PCB mechanically supports and electrically connects electronic components using conductive tracks, pads and other features etched from one or more sheet layers of copper laminated onto and/or between sheet layers of a non-conductive substrate. (Source: allaboutcircuits website).  </br>
           
                <p>Why do we make it ourselfs?</br>
        The reason we create our own PCBs is because we are able to customize the electronics to meet our product requirements and lower the overall footprint. It also allows us to learn more about what goes on in electronics production.</br>
    
    <h3>In-System Programmer(ISP)</h3>
                <p>What is an ISP?</br>    
                   Also called in-circuit serial programming (ICSP), is the ability of some programmable logic devices, microcontrollers, and other embedded devices to be programmed while installed in a complete system, rather than requiring the chip to be programmed prior to installing it into the system. It allows firmware updates to be delivered to the on-chip memory of microcontrollers and related processors without requiring specialist programming circuitry on the circuit board, and simplifies design work.(Source: Wikipedia) This was the first PCB that we were taught to do.</br>
    
        
            <h3>Individual Assignment</h3>   
                   For our assignment, we were assigned to mill an ISP board. I had to convert the 2 PNG images of the ISP board, mainly the outline and the traces, to Gcodes. To do this, I used mods to generate the codes. </br>
