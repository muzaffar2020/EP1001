                 <h2>Module Project: Automatic Cat Feeder</h2>
                    <p>For the final module project, I have decide to make an automatic cat feeder. I have a cat named Cheetah and he eats a lot. That got me thinking into designing and making an automatic feeder for him. However, to make it a little more challenging, I will be implementing a lcd I2c screen to display messages and push buttons for different modes of feeding. </br><p><img src="images/cat.jpg.png" width="430" lenght="230" /></br>
                <h3>Final Product</h3>
                Here you can see a hero shot of my project and it working in action. Pardon the song and mess in the background. Music helps me stay awake at 2am :).  The documentation of the project will be below this section. There will also be a link below to my 1 minute video for the module project.</br>

                <br><h3>Planning</h3>
                As for planning, I simply drew out some rough ideas on a page. It has been quite a while since I drew anything so it was nice to stretch my fingers. </b>
                <p><img src="images/planning.jpg.png" width="460" lenght="260" />
                
                
                <br><h3>Custom PCB board</h3>
<p>Electronics needed:
                <ul>
                        <li>Custom PCB board </li>
                        <li>4,3 and 2 pin headers</li>
                        <li>0.1uf capacitor</li>
                        <li>2 x 1002 resistors</li>
                    <li>Attiny412</li>
                    </ul>
        <p>This being the first time designing, I asked Mr Steven to help me out. So we designed a rough idea of how the board would look like on the whiteboard. Since I did not need too many pins, I opted to use the attiny412 as my main processor. I will be implementing 2 push buttons and an I2c lcd. </br>
<img src="images/planning.png" width="430" lenght="230" /></br>


        <p>I started out by designing the cicuit via eagle. It took quite some time to route the lines for the board. I tried using the autoroute function but the results were not to my liking. So I manually routed the lines.  </br><img src="images/pcb1.png" width="630" lenght="430" /></br><img src="images/pcb2.png" width="430" lenght="230" /></br>
                
  
             
<p>Next , I milled the board using the stepcraft machine. Here you can see the milled board. Fortunately for me, I only had to mill the board once. I am not very confident in my soldering, so I decided to slowly peel the unused copper. I did so with a pen knife and carefully peeling it afterwards. It took quite a bit and my fingers were starting to hurt. The finished product was very satisfiying as I could see the individual copper lines. Afterwards, I layed the components that were going to be soldered.</br>

 <img src="images/pcb5.png" width="380" lenght="180" />
    <img src="images/pcb6.png" width="390" lenght="180" /></br>
    
<p>Here is the how the boards looks like after soldering. I was pretty impressed with how my soldering turned out. The board look much better from my previous attempts in soldering. </br>
       <img src="images/pcb7.png" width="590" lenght="380" /></br>

<p>After soldering, I double checked the connections with a multimeter before trying out simple codes for the components that will be used. You can see below that I managed to successfully input a simple servo coding as well as a hello world for the I2c LCD. It did however take lots of trouble shooting for the I2c as it was outputting error codes. Fortunately after a bit of help from Mr Steven, it turns out that the SDA and SCL wires were mixed up. </br>

        <br><h3>Programming PCB board</h3>
<p>To code the board, I used the Arduino app. For my design, I wanted the feeder to have 2 modes of dispensing food. One is for dispensing the food immediately and one for every 3 hours. This coding turned out very difficult for me. I tried using delay commands to execute my coding. However, I learnt that it had a limitation. During the delay operation, nothing else will be done by the board. This meant that I the feeder could not rotate every 3 hours or so.  </br>
       <img src="images/delaycoding1.PNG" width="590" lenght="380" /></br>
 <img src="images/delaycoding2.PNG" width="590" lenght="380" /></br>
<p>I tried out another method which is usuing millis. Mr Steven showed me example codes and went through explaining the coding for me. Unfortunately, even after many attempts, I could not succesfully create a code that worked for me. So for presentation purposes, I will use the delay coding. </br>

               <br> <h3>3D Printing</h3>
                 This is probably my favourite part of this project. I had done 3d printing for DFAB 1 so I could not wait to get started again. I ended up printing quite a number of parts. I used Fusion360 to make the 3d models before slicing them in cura. </br>
The parts are:
<ul>
                        <li>Hopper </li>
                        <li>Hopper cap</li>
                        <li>Feeder</li>
                        <li>Auger</li>
                        <li>Lcd underside plate</li>
                       <li>Lcd top plate</li>
                        <li>Servo mount 1</li>
                        <li>Servo mount 2</li>
                    </ul>
Once again, I learnt that doing it right the first time is crucial. I had to print the feeder a couple times because the dimensions that I used were wrong. However, I was really impressed with how my auger turned out. I managed to 3d print the auger in two pieces which I thought was pretty cool. I have to give the credits to the Youtube channel Product Design Online. The video on how to create 3d printable augers was really helpful. </br>

                <br><h3>Laser cutting</h3>
                 The feeder case was to be made via laser cutting. I designed the parts in Autocad.  </br>          
                   <img src="images/lasercut1.png" width="380" lenght="180" />          
<img src="images/lasercut2.jpg" width="480" lenght="380" /></br>
 <br><h3>Assembling</h3>
<p>I started off the assembly process by super gluing the auger together. I printed the auger in 2 halves so that they would not require as much support. Next I used m4 nuts and bolts to screw the servo plate onto the servo.</br>
<img src="images/assembly1.jpg" width="380" lenght="180" />
<img src="images/assembly2.jpg" width="380" lenght="180" /></br>

<p>Next, I used m4 screws to screw the servo cap end and the plate togther. As you can see in the image, the tolerance of the holes I designed on the cap end were just nice and the screws basically created their own threads since they were much harder than the 3d print material so it was a bonus for me.</br>
<img src="images/assembly3.jpg" width="380" lenght="180" />
<img src="images/assembly4.jpg" width="380" lenght="180" /></br>

<p>Moving on, I super glued the servo connector to the auger. Since it did not affect my design, I felt that I did not need to design a specific connector from the auger to the servo and that I could simply reuse the one that came with it. Following that, I used velcro tape to secure the pvc pipe supports. This allows me to move the supports around in case I needed space.</br>
<img src="images/assembly5.jpg" width="380" lenght="180" />
<img src="images/assembly6.jpg" width="380" lenght="180" /></br>

<p>With the previous items assembled, I could assemble the main body. Here is what it looks like with all the previous parts assembled. I went on to try out my test coding to confirm that everything works.</br>

<source src="images/testing1.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video> </br>
                

<p>Now onto the laser cut box. I decided to use hot glue to to its simplicity. I didnt glue all sides because I wanted to test the fitting. So you can see below that it fit perfectly.</br>
<img src="images/assembly8.jpg" width="380" lenght="180" />
<img src="images/assembly9.jpg" width="380" lenght="180" /></br>

 <p>With the fitting confirmed, I could permanently put the pcb. I decided to drill 2 holes and use the leftover m4 screws to put the pcb inside the laser cut box. This was crucial as I need the wires to be able to reach their intended locationd without needed any extensions for simplicity.</br>
<img src="images/assembly10.jpg" width="380" lenght="180" />
<img src="images/assembly11.jpg" width="380" lenght="180" /></br>

<p>Next, it was time to add the lcd screen and push button. I used double sided tape to secure the lcd screen onto its specially designed plate and hot glued it onto the casing. Also not forgetting the flower casting that </br> 
<img src="images/assembly13.jpg" width="380" lenght="180" />
<img src="images/assembly14.jpg" width="380" lenght="180" /></br>

<p>Last but not least, I double sided taped the flower casting that I did beforehand. The cast reminded me of my cat Cheetah when I brought him out for a walk one time. I kept trying to bite them and was soo attracted to the butterflies flying around them. Whcih was why I decided to add the cast onto my project, to add abit of personal touch.</br>
